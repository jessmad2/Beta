# Beta
Beta Club
  When we first began we had no clue as to what we were doing. Over the school year we learned how to add images, add different website pages, add links, change colors, and the list goes on and on.

  For our profect we chose to make a website for our school Beta club. We chose Beta because they did not have a page of there own and we wanted to promote what Beta does and is. 
  
    Along the way we had various set backs in designing and creating our website. For example, we weren't sure how to do some of the things we wanted to accomplish. When we didn't know how to perform a task we went and researched the code for it and got the job done. 
    
    We started making our website by wire framing on scratch paper just to see what we were both wanting it to look like. We also looked up other schools Beta website pages to get an idea of how we wanted ours to look. After looking and compromising on what we both wanted we sat down and get to work. 

   First, we started in codepen with a blank work space. We then began on our home page. We started by picking out the color template, the pictures, and fonts that we thought would look best with our layout. We outlined the basis homepage then added the CSS to it to spice it up. 
   
    With our other pages we copied and pasted the layout of the home page and changed it to make the contact, gallery, and the links pages.
    
      Finally, we started to tweek all of the mistakes and scaled our website to fit all screens. We hope our school Beta Club will get good use out of our website.
